##Walkthrough of SVG Shape Generator Application
<!-- This JavaScript code generates SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics) shapes based on user input using the Inquirer.js library. -->

##Importing Required Modules
    <!-- inquirer: Allows interaction with the user through the command-line interface by presenting prompts and collecting user input.
    fs: Provides functions for interacting with the file system.
    { Circle, Square, Triangle, renderShape }: Imports custom shape classes and a function for rendering shapes. -->

##Function to Write SVG Data to a File
    <!-- writeToFile: Accepts a file name and SVG data as parameters, then writes the SVG data to the specified file. -->

##Function to Initialize the Application
    <!-- init: Displays prompts to the user using Inquirer.js to gather information about the shape, shape color, text, and text color.
    .then: Renders the shape based on the user's responses and outputs the SVG data to the console. It also writes the SVG data to a file named shape.svg using the writeToFile function.
    .catch: Handles any errors that occur during the prompt process. -->

##Shape Classes and Rendering Function
<!-- The code relies on custom shape classes (Circle, Square, Triangle) and a renderShape function to generate SVG data based on the user's input. These components are assumed to be defined in the ./lib/shapes module.

Overall, this code creates a simple command-line application that allows users to generate SVG shapes with customizable attributes. -->
